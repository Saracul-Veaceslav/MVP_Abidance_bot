# Python Crypto Algorithmic Trading Bot
## Project Description
A Python-based cryptocurrency algorithmic trading bot that automates trading on Binance. The bot will operate 24/7, collecting market data, executing trading strategies, managing risk, and adaptively optimizing its performance over time. It will initially implement trend following strategies as an MVP, with plans to evolve toward machine learning/AI-driven strategies using reinforcement learning. The bot will support multiple cryptocurrency pairs simultaneously and include a web-based interface for monitoring performance. The system will start with paper trading to validate strategies before potentially moving to live trading.
