# New Knowledge Base

This document tracks insights and learnings about the codebase that help improve development productivity.

## Architecture Insights
- The system follows a modular, event-driven architecture that separates concerns between data collection, strategy execution, risk management, and performance monitoring
- Each major component is designed to be independently scalable and testable
- The use of abstract base classes and interfaces allows for easy extension of strategies and risk management rules
- Server and client components are clearly separated with well-defined interfaces
- Real-time updates use a combination of WebSocket and server-sent events for optimal performance

## Development Patterns
- Strategy implementations follow the Template Method pattern for consistent lifecycle management
- Risk management uses the Chain of Responsibility pattern for evaluating multiple risk rules
- Performance monitoring implements the Observer pattern for real-time metric updates
- Configuration management uses the Builder pattern with Pydantic for type-safe settings
- Server actions follow a consistent pattern with optimistic updates and error handling
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout of new functionality

## Testing Practices
- All features are developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Tests follow Gherkin-style documentation for better readability and maintainability
- Each component has dedicated test fixtures and factories for consistent test setup
- Integration tests use Docker containers for consistent database testing
- Performance testing includes both load testing and memory usage monitoring
- End-to-end tests cover critical user flows with Cypress
- Component tests use React Testing Library for user-centric testing

## Performance Considerations
- Database operations use connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- WebSocket connections implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Long-running operations are monitored with Prometheus metrics
- Critical paths include circuit breakers to prevent system overload
- Server-side rendering optimizes initial page loads
- Client-side caching improves data access performance
- Real-time updates are batched for efficiency

## Error Handling
- All external API calls include retry logic with configurable backoff
- Database operations are wrapped in transactions for data consistency
- WebSocket disconnections are handled gracefully with state recovery
- System errors are logged with structured data for easier debugging
- Client-side errors are tracked with PostHog analytics
- Form validations use Zod for type-safe schemas
- API responses follow consistent error formats

## Deployment Best Practices
- Multi-stage Docker builds minimize final image size
- Services are configured via environment variables for flexibility
- Health checks ensure system components are functioning correctly
- Backup and recovery procedures are automated and tested regularly
- Feature flags enable safe production deployments
- Analytics track user behavior and system performance
- Subscription management handles billing lifecycle

## Security Considerations
- API keys and secrets are managed through environment variables
- Database connections use connection pooling with SSL
- WebSocket connections require authentication tokens
- Rate limiting is implemented for all public endpoints
- Authentication uses Clerk for secure user management
- Role-based access control protects sensitive operations
- Stripe handles payment information securely

## Project Structure
- The project follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns
- Each component has a specific responsibility in the trading workflow
- Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling between components
- Component organization follows Next.js app router conventions
- Shared UI components use shadcn/ui for consistency
- Server and client code are clearly separated
- Testing follows the same structure as source code

## Technical Implementation
- TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension) provides optimized time-series data storage
- Using hypertables for efficient querying of time-series data
- FastAPI provides high-performance async API endpoints
- WebSocket connections provide real-time data updates to the frontend
- Reinforcement Learning models can be trained and evaluated through the UI
- PostHog provides analytics and feature flag management
- Stripe handles subscription billing and webhooks

## Trading System Insights
- Risk management parameters can be configured per strategy
- Paper trading mode allows testing without real funds
- Multiple trading strategies can run simultaneously
- Performance metrics track the system's effectiveness
- The system supports multiple timeframes and trading pairs
- Subscription tiers control access to advanced features
- Real-time analytics track trading performance

## Development Workflow
- Detailed technical specification guides implementation
- Comprehensive database schema supports trading operations
- Backend API organized by functional domains
- Frontend implements responsive design for monitoring on various devices
- WebSocket service handles reconnection automatically with exponential backoff
- Component development follows design system guidelines
- Testing is integrated into the development process
